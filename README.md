# Portfolio

This is a webpage portfolio of my work. I will be adding more projects along the way and making this page more responsive. I hope you have fun following along my coding journey.

## Why Bootstrap?

I am using bootstrap because it is very responsive without all the knowledge and headache of css. Of course I will be using my own css file for this page to help style it a little more to my liking.

## Special thanks

Special thanks to those at pexels that allow free use of their pictures.

Also to the developers that made Bootstrap. Thank you for making an open source and easy to use framework. Words can't describe the graditude towards them.
