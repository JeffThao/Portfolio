# Portfolio

This is a webpage portfolio of my work. I will be adding more projects along the way and making this page more responsive. I hope you have fun following along my coding journey.

## Why Bootstrap?

I am using bootstrap because it is very responsive without all the knowledge and headache of css. Of course I will be using my own css file for this page to help style it a little more to my liking.

## Special thanks

Special to the developers that made Bootstrap. Thank you for making an open source and easy to use framework. Words can't describe the graditude towards them.

## Work

#### What's Cooking?
The What's Cooking application let's users look for recipes by searching for ingredients that they already have. This is a great tool to have if you're making a last minute meal and is unsure of what to make, or if you have leftover ingredients from another dish. You can look up what else you can make with it.

#### Password Generator
The Password Generator let's users decide how many characters they would like for their new password. It also asks for lowercase, uppercase, special characters, or numbers. Once you hit the button to generate a password, it will take what you want in your password and generate a random password for you to use.

#### Daily Planner
Tired of forgetting what you needed to do at 10 AM? Well, this daily planner will help you keep track of your daily tasks! Just put down what tasks you need to do, or meetings you need to go to in the designated hour. The planner will hold information for you so you can look at it later and see what you need to do!
